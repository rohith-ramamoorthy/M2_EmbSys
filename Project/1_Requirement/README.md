# Vehicle Heat Monitoring System



# Introduction
Self-driving automobiles will be the future in the age of artificial intelligence, with autonomy in the hands of the autonomous vehicle's circuits. There will be manual-driven automobiles on the road alongside autonomous vehicles. As a result, the impact of vehicle monitoring in enterprises today is quite astounding in terms of ensuring safety and security, checking condition, and improving vehicular efficiency. The created Vehicle Monitoring System (V.M.S.) focuses on monitoring a vehicle that has this system installed inside of it. When this technology is turned on, it will continuously monitor the vehicle's location, co-content, and collision scenarios. As long as the V.M.S. is up and running and powered on, it will continue to do the tasks that have been assigned to it. The main goal of our project is to build and construct a system that can monitor the passenger's existence as well as Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Research
Depending on the surroundings, the vehicle monitoring system can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be easily adjusted, modified, or redesigned to respond in accordance with the environment's needs as and when they arise. Today's Comfort Control Systems help us more than ever before. They're in charge of keeping your automobile clean, cooling it down on a hot summer day, and employing Cruise Control to keep it moving at a constant speed. This microcontroller is found in a wide range of devices, including vehicles, because it is simple to incorporate.

# Features
The passenger can adjust the temperature by looking at the display, which is provided in the system. Modular Programming is a type of programming that is based on modules. The temperature in the car can be changed by both the driver and the passenger. It is capable of determining whether the user is in the car or not.
